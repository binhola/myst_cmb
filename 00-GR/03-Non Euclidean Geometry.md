# Non-Euclidean Geometry

## Manifold and tangent space
### Curved spacetime
Manifold $\mathcal{M}$ not a vector space -> no global system of cartersian coordinates. However, at each point $M \in \mathcal{M}$, exists a tangent space which comes with a cartersian coord system
#### General coordinate system
$\mathcal{M}$ comes with an arbitrary system of coordinate $x^\mu$

#### Tangent space TpM
