# Inflation

## Motivation

### Causality problem
- decelerated $a \propto t^n$ and $n < 1$ so that $\ddot{a} < 0$
#### Causal horizon
$$
d_h \equiv a(t_2) \int_{t_1}^{t_2} \dfrac{dt}{a(t)}
$$
With ${t_2 \ll t_1}$ then
$$
d_h = \dfrac{t_2}{1 - n} \Rightarrow \ddot{d_h} = 0
$$
where the Hubble radius
$$
R_H = \dfrac{1}{H} = \dfrac{t_c}{n}
$$

All the modes outside Hubble horizon (no causal) but eventually enter the horizon and causually connected to each other.

If we consider a small enough $t_i$, all the observable modes are acausal.

$$
\lambda(t_i) \ll R_H(t_i)
$$

Observation of CMB showed that modes $\lambda(t_{dec}) \ll R_H(t_{dec})$ had been initially in causal contact.

Accelerated expansion: 
$$
\ddot{a} &> 0 (\text{e.g. de Sitter}) \\
\ddot{\lambda} &> 0
$$

Causal horizon: 
$$
R_H = \dfrac{1}{H} = \text{const} \\
d_H = \dfrac{1}{H} (e^{H(t_2 - t_1)} - 1)
$$

if $t_2 \ll t_1$ we have
$$
\dfrac{e^{H(t_2 - t_1)}}{H} = R_H \dfrac{a(t_2)}{a(t_1)}
$$
