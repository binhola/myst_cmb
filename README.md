[![Made with MyST](https://img.shields.io/badge/made%20with-myst-orange)](https://myst.tools)

This repository contains my CMB Polarization Notes, built using MyST Markdown and Jupyter notebooks.
It’s a living collection of theory, calculations, and reproducible notebooks for studying the Cosmic Microwave Background.

> **Note** This project is intended as a personal, structured scientific notebook.

The goals of this project are:

1. Create a `myst` site, using the standard template
2. Improve the frontmatter, to add authors, affiliations and other metadata
3. Export the paper as a PDF, Word document, and LaTeX files
4. Integrate a Jupyter Notebook output into our paper, to improve reproducibility
5. Publish a website of with our work 🚀
