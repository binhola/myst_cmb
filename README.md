# Cosmology Notes

[![Made with MyST](https://img.shields.io/badge/made%20with-myst-orange)](https://myst.tools)

This repository contains my **personal Cosmology lecture notes**, written as a structured scientific notebook using **MyST Markdown**.

These notes closely follow the lectures taught in the NPAC cosmology curriculum:
- **Advanced Cosmology** — *Josquin Errard, Pauline Zarrouk*
- **Additional Topics in Astroparticles and Cosmology** — *Daniel Steer, Pauline Zarrouk, Matteo Cerruti*

They are written as **lecture notes**, combining theory, physical intuition, and mathematical derivations, with a focus on clarity and step-by-step understanding.

## Purpose

- Organize lecture material in a clean and readable format  
- Collect key equations, definitions, and derivations  
- Serve as long-term study and revision notes  

> **Note**: This project is intended for **personal academic use** by NPAC students.  
> It is not an official course document and does not replace attending lectures.

## Topics Covered

- Cosmological perturbation theory  
- CMB physics and statistics  
- Inflation and early-universe physics  
- Large-scale structure  
- Astroparticle cosmology  

(The content grows as the lectures progress.)
